# JPACRUDProject

# Description
My homepage shows the title of my webpage and under it has a form that asks for user input for an id, this id will bring you to a specific ID ad display information that the data base already has inputted by me or if it was one of the recent inputs then it could be one from the user. If you click on show all sessions then all the dates will be displayed when the Date was inputted (Dates are not null in my database) Once you select a specific date or ID then it will show all information inputted in a table. Once you are in a specific session you can update it or delete it. If  the session was successfully deleted the user will be directed to a page that says so. If you update a session and click the submit button then you will be redirected to the sessions information page. If you try to look up a ID that does not exist you will be told so.

# Lessons Learned


I was trying to make it harder on myself with create and updates. 

Spring is awesome 

Getting forms to post and get has my brain in a million knots.

I forgot to write things in English and then translate to code, once I did that I really was able to understand the path from a form that is a get then once it posts where I can direct the next page to go.

TA hours are a lifesavers. If I didn’t have them I would still be looking at 400,404 and 500 errors.

Reading the console helps but it doesn’t point to the exact problem.

Junit tests are not as hard as I thought
